    feedback: "Vinit was a star front-end developer on our team. He joined us when the 2nd major version of the product was already out. He quickly understood the product and code base and moved from bug fixing to building complex new components for the app. Vinit interacted well with back end teams, designers and product team which showed that he looked at what he was building in a comprehensive way. He played a critical role in the release of the 3rd major version of our mobile app. When he was challenged to build a POC in Flutter in 2 weeks, Vinit took up the challenge and delivered on it without any complaints. He was our one source of review on all new south Indian movies being released in theatres and OTT services. It was a pleasure working with Vinit at Glide Invest.",

    feedback: "I worked with Vinit at Glide Invest (Motilal Oswal) and he's one of the rockstar techies of the team. He's very passionate about tech and is always open to challenges. We faced a lot of challenges while building the product and somehow he managed to overcome all of them in the required time. He shares his opinions (sometimes opposing) about the features that we built together - a rare quality in a techie that helps in building meaningful products. I hope that we cross paths again in future as well. Cheers",
